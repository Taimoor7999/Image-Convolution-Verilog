Project: Image Convolution Verilog 
Step by step procedure
I have use MATLAB code input_72_bits to convert my KDOT_jp image to 72 bits binary (65536 lines) and store it in input_image72 txt file. Use it in the testbench in quartus prime. Run the simulation on Modelsim and generated the output_image72 txt file of 65536 lines (8 bits binary). Used another MATLAB code to convert the output_image72 txt file in image.
